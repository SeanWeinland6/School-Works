# Three Types of important algorithms:

1. Knapsack (Greedy Approach)
Complexity: O(nlog(n))

This problem is about optimizing how many items you can fit within a bag.
This is about having a set weight, and maxamizing what is the best value of items we can fit in our bag
while still being within our weight budget.

2. Merge Sort
Complexity: O(nlog(n))

This problem is splitting up data, sorting it in two different arrays/vectors, then grouping them back up together.
My program utilizes heapsort and merge sort together.


3. Dijkstra - Minimal Spanning Tree
Complexity: O(|E|*|V|) or |V3|

This algorithm will try to find the minimal distance between nodes.
It utilizes methods related to graph theory, like edges, matrix's, and adjancey lists.
