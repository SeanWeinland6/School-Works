/* Sample main (this file is not a unit test!)

 * This file is for developing your own tests to make sure that your code is
    runnable for different use cases.

 * std::vector is included in the code below to show you how your types should
    behave. Feel free to use that for debugging purposes.


 * Make sure to test your vector with multiple types!!

 * In the main function (or multiple mains) you should write your own
    "unit tests" for each function; one suggestion may be one main per function.
