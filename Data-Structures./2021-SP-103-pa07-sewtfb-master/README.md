Programming assignment 7
==============================

![matrix](matrix.png)

Your tasks are:

1. to write the MyUnorderedMap functions

2. to write a function, get_virus_frequency(), that accepts an
arbitrary number of lines from standard input and builds a MyUnorderedMap containing the
number of occurances for every word containing the word "Virus" in it, i.e., if the word
"CryptoLockerVirus" appears 15 times in the input code, then map["CryptoLockerVirus"] should return 15.
An example of the behavior of this function is at the end of pa06.cpp, which expects \<sample_input.txt


```cpp
// Some actual C++ source code (your sample_input.cpp)

cout <<reallyBig_badvirus37()<< endl;
```

```cpp
// your actual get_virus_frequency code:

myhashdictionary["reallyBig_badvirus37"] = 1;

myhashdictionary["reallyBig_badvirus37"]++;
```

```sh
# This is how you'd run

g++ pa07.cpp

./a.out <sample_input.txt
```

Hint: you cant just define word boundaries by spaces, because this is code. 
You will need to define word boundaries by special characters too.

## Assignment Notes
You will implement a dictionary (abstract data type) using a hash table
data structure that will have similar functionality to std::unordered_map.

Deliverable: You must submit a file, `MyUnorderedMap.hpp`, that contains the implementations of 
1. all of your MyUnorderedMap functions and
2. get_virus_frequency()
3. your name function

Git commands and a Git cheatsheet are posted under the syllabus, under the heading "Programming Assignments":

* We will grade on a large hash table.
